2005 Jaguar XJ 4.2 Special Equipment,"1:30 PM, 06 NOV 2025",56 Bids,"['Xenon Headlamps', '£2,500 Spent on Sales Preparation', 'Heated Seats', '18” Dynamic Alloy Wheels', 'Machine Polished – Ceramic Sealing', 'Electric Rear Blinds', 'Parking Sensors']",SAJKC72P45SG38139,"45,800 Miles",4190cc,Auto,Emerald Fire,"Very few manufacturers come close to matching the classy, elegant interiors offered by Jaguar at their best.
The interior of this example is no exception and is pretty much a masterclass in the arcane skills of the saddler and the French polisher.
Pretty much everything in the gentlemen’s club-like interior is in exemplary order, not least because it has been professionally detailed and the leather cleaned and fed with high quality products. 
The wood veneers on the dashboard, door cappings and centre console wouldn’t look out of place on a Sheraton table and are relentlessly rich, glossy and opulent. 
The ‘Barley’ leather seats are comfortable, supportive and fully functional, front and back.
There’s more cream-coloured hide in here than you’d find at a Jersey cattle market, and all of it is supple, rich, welcoming and untroubled by anything so vulgar as a crease.
There are no meaningful signs of wear anywhere that we can discern.
The door cards are excellent, as is the headlining.
The brown carpets and mats are following the same impressive script in terms of quality and condition. 
The wood and leather steering wheel, gear selector and handbrake are entirely unblemished.
As far as we’re aware, all switches, dials, buttons, levers and instruments do exactly as they’re told without any displays of tardiness or petulance.
The rear central armrest hosts a control unit for the entertainment system. Its counterpart at the front contains two cup holders, the black plastic surround to which is starting to shed some of its lacquer.
The vast boot, needless to say, is immaculate and doesn’t look as if it’s ever played host to anything weightier or bulkier than a raincoat or a hat.
It contains a space-saver wheel.",Right-Hand Drive,Petrol,"Bonhams|Cars Online HQ, United Kingdom","In 2003, Jaguar introduced the re-engineered and newly designed third generation of the XJ, designated internally as the X350. 
It had an all-aluminium body and chassis, a 3.0-litre V6 engine, and new 3.5 and 4.2-litre V8 engines. It was the first Jaguar XJ to be completely designed under Ford ownership (which soon became Tata ownership) and introduced an array of new electronics and computer-controlled systems. 
A new, lighter, six-speed automatic gearbox was fitted, offering improved economy and a wider spectrum of gear ratios.
The X350's aluminum bodyshell used an aerospace construction method; a hybrid of adhesive bonding and rivet joinery known as rivet-bonding or riv-bonding. 
An industry first in volume automotive production, this technique resulted in a monocoque chassis that was both 40% lighter and 50% stiffer than that of the outgoing model. 
The styling of its aluminium body panels was an evolution of the classic XJ look and marked the final (and much missed) expression of that signature aesthetic. 
Air suspension was fitted at the front and rear, providing adaptive damping as well as rear self-leveling, with computer-controlled ride height and suspension modes. Dynamic stability control and traction control were standard. 
The Grace, Space and Pace bloodline linking (almost) every offering from Castle Bromwich for the past 50 years was still clearly running through the veins of the X350.","The vendor and his invariably superb cars are very well-known to all of us here at HQ.
He has carved out a successful niche in importing exceptional Jaguars and other prestige cars from Japan.
He understands and appreciates that luxury European brands have a good deal of kudos attached to them in the land of the rising sun and that, consequently, they are almost always pampered, cared-for, protected and curated with levels of care verging on the obsessive.
He also knows that salt is used for throwing over the shoulders of Sumo wrestlers in Japan, not chucking all over the roads, as we do for some woeful reason in this country.
All of these factors combined mean that Japanese cars coming our way from this vendor are always minty-fresh, squeaky-clean, salt-free and, frankly, world-class.
This particular model is the rarer and more coveted SE (Special Equipment) SWB (Short Wheelbase) iteration of the X350 XJ8, meaning it has the handling and dynamics to really make the most of the car’s fine 4.2-litre engine and powertrain. 
Highlights on its long and comprehensive options list include the following.
18″ Dynamic Alloy Wheels with Pirelli P Zero Tyres
Bi-Xenon Headlamps with Power Wash
Front and Rear Parking Sensors
Front Fog Lamps
Power-Folding Door Mirrors
Reverse Camera
Heated and Electrically Adjustable Front Seats with Memory
Electrically Adjustable Pedals and Mirrors with Memory
Heated and Reclining Rear Seats with Memory
Electric Rear Window Blind
Rear Door Sun Blinds
Touchscreen UK Satellite Navigation
Cruise Control
Alpine Premium Audio System with Subwoofer
Wood and Leather Multifunction Steering Wheel
It starts, drives, handles and stops with all the capability and refinement we’ve come to know and appreciate in these always impressive cars. 
‘Emerald Fire’ with ‘Barley’ hide leather interior, it is also in quite exceptional condition, inside and out, even by the lofty standards of the vendor.
The car is virtually unmarked inside and out, there’s no corrosion anywhere that we can see, and it has been fully switched to UK spec – MPH speedometer/odometer, UK satellite navigation, UK lights, and full-sized front and rear number plate plinths.",Private: v12vandenplas,"We advise selling your television. 
You don’t need it. 
Just get a comfy chair, some decent lighting, and spend your free time staring at this car.
The extraordinary ‘Emerald Fire’ paintwork is a dazzlingly mesmeric colour and one that shifts and morphs like a chimaera as the light refracts into countless hues ranging from deep green to teal-blue and everything in between.
And, just to make sure the finish pops and signs optimally in the sunshine, it’s been machine polished and finished with ceramic sealant.
Even entirely standard light scratches, scuffs and stone chips are far more notable for their absence than their presence.
Underneath the paintwork you will find pristine bodywork that’s untroubled by any dinks, dents, creases, dimples or wrinkles that we can see anywhere.
The shut-lines and panel gaps look crisp, consistent and even. 
All four alloy wheels appear to be untroubled by any unwarranted encounters with kerbs or other roadside obstacles, and the matching 235/50 ZR18 Pirelli P-Zero tyres look to have a reasonable amount of life left in them. 
The car’s chrome-work is free of any foxing or tarnishing, and the lights, lenses, badging and other exterior fixtures and fittings all look utterly untroubled by time, use, weather or other external factors.
As is virtually always the case with this particular feature (on various makes of car), the satin-finish alloy trim surrounding the side windows has adopted a faintly mottled pattern.","https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/22c18ec0-1090-480b-975f-bb67e95177e4.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/6be63205-8988-4e89-9382-f053821e07d0.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/66fb8718-447a-4279-9448-9df7f14b1b58.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/2b57eb4f-968c-4fde-a101-54ba460be17c.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/ca2d0f39-ca13-47a0-91b9-4253eed2f9b4.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/2c97a3d6-de72-4e3e-9d39-7b86fe1aa3fa.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/f0959c23-3a4a-4d48-bf70-e7f29bc3ceef.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/290d74ef-7eff-431e-a9fd-4ef1c3f947c6.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/fc82b121-af36-4c74-911a-c1e6f18049ce.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/873b6b55-fc51-4ac1-bdbe-48d620998e7e.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/29e9e60c-eb1d-4af6-a32f-d3b4a48ca769.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/ab03b563-f982-4b21-bfd7-470f51255476.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/e3efc0a9-4fde-4c5f-ad23-d1c4aaeed043.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/ecc51403-cd2e-43fe-966b-cc381981206a.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/c088b942-f751-4383-9a78-d5aac16ac9e5.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/c53d667e-64fb-4e10-a964-c07d8dc9dad1.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/91290603-52bc-4264-b430-f1392c6bda16.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/bc4a69c4-9130-44a0-8e0c-ec3bc7f1cd27.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/18c3e77a-ff6f-46df-9629-e7ec2e136a35.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/f2408227-a0fd-444a-b4c7-6c752830475c.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/0c9941bd-0137-4b4d-8d67-ef609866ce11.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/8365afe1-f6b8-4bd0-84fd-dd83728a8829.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/058d0c1d-43ad-442c-baa8-771f06774d62.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/00eb5cc1-6779-4c3f-8acb-aaea5e623e7b.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/429de59c-8fa0-4587-bb9d-b2aee65b7776.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/0cdbd6e3-cf3d-4730-a0db-915161cd5927.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/c2e74d8a-ec21-48fe-94d5-a1f5645528ec.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/d225d491-23c2-4636-a76d-b0de0a5ce274.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/46b9d060-cb16-4114-800f-fc7d3488ff61.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188, https://bonhamscarsonline.twic.pics/d0f91d7a-5758-4cf1-ac3e-317a18469d81/48ff8888-1cc3-4ccb-bf36-b3b631c81695.jpg?twic=v1/resize=650&twic=v1/cover=250x188",na,na,na,na,na
